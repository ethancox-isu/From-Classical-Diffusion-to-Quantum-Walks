# From Classical Diffusion to Quantum Walks
Modeling Quantum Recurrence, Topology, and Decoherence

This project builds on my prior undergraduate research in random walks, absorbing Markov chains, and topological data analysis, extending those classical ideas into quantum algorithms through discrete-time quantum walks. I simulate both classical and quantum recurrence behavior on various graph structures (e.g., grids, cycles, and hypercubes), visualizing how interference and decoherence shape the walk’s evolution.

Inspired by work done in quantum algorithms, especially in gate-level simulation of noisy physical quantum systems and error-correcting architectures, I’ve also introduced noise models to study the fragility and robustness of quantum walk behavior. These initial simulations serve as a conceptual bridge toward more physically grounded modeling, such as superconducting circuits or fault-tolerant gate implementations.

Potential Extensions:
- Implement a noisy quantum walk model using Qiskit pulse-level noise models or Qiskit-AER backends.
- Use quantum walks to simulate a search on a marked graph, then add decoherence and analyze performance degradation.
- Connect my results to quantum error correction intuition (e.g., how interference collapses under certain noise thresholds).
